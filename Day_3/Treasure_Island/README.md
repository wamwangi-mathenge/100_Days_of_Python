# Treasure Hunt Game

Welcome to the Treasure Hunt game! This Python program allows you to embark on a thrilling adventure and make choices that determine your fate. Will you find the treasure, or will it be game over?

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE:
    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```
2. The game will start, and you'll find yourself at a crossroads. You can choose to go "left" or "right" by typing your choice and pressing Enter.

3. Depending on your choice, you'll face different challenges and decisions, each with its own consequences. Follow the prompts and make your selections to progress through the game.

4. The game will ultimately lead you to a critical decision involving three doors of different colors: red, yellow, and blue. Your choice here will determine if you find the treasure and win the game or face an unfortunate outcome.

5. Enjoy the adventure and have fun exploring the different paths and outcomes of the game!

## Game Rules
- The game is designed to be interactive, and your choices matter. Make sure to read the prompts and make your selections carefully.

- The objective is to find the treasure by making the right choices. If you choose poorly, you may encounter various challenges that lead to a "Game Over" scenario.

- The game is text-based, and it's all about exploring your own adventure and enjoying the journey.

## Customize and Extend
Feel free to modify the Python script to create your own version of the game with different scenarios, challenges, or outcomes. You can expand the game by adding more choices, challenges, or paths to explore.
