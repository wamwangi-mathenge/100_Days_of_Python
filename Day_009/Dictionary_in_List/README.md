# Instructions

You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a `List` that contains 2 `Dictionaries`. Your job is to create a function that can add new countries to this list.

Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Brazil to the travel_log.

```
add_new_country("Brazil", 5, ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"])
```

`DO NOT` modify the travel_log directly. The goal is to create a function that modifies it.

### Example Input
Brazil\
5\
["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"]

### Example Output
I've been to Brazil 5 times.\
My favorite city was Sao Paulo.

## Hint
- Look at the function call above to see what the name of the function should be.
- The inputs for the function are positional arguments. The order is very important.
- Feel free to choose your own parameter names.
