# Instructions

You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

`Important:` You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 1 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

`NOTE:` Don't worry about getting hold of the input(), we've done the work behind the scenes to import everything.

`HINT:` Assume that names looks like this: input: x, y, z, names = ["x", "y", "z"]

### Example Input
Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe\
Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

### Example Output
Michael is going to buy the meal today!
