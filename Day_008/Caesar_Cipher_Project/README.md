# Caesar's Cipher Project

## Overview
This Python program implements Caesar's Cipher, a simple encryption and decryption technique. The user can choose to encode or decode a message by specifying the shift amount. The program handles the alphabet wrap-around and ignores non-alphabetic characters during encoding and decoding.

## Features
1. `Encryption and Decryption`: Users can choose to either encode or decode a message.
2. `Alphabet Wrap-around`: The program handles shifts that exceed the length of the alphabet.
3. `Non-alphabetic Characters`: Numbers, symbols, and spaces are preserved and remain unchanged during encoding and decoding.
4. `Restart Capability`: Users can choose to restart the program after completing an operation.

## Usage
1. Run the program and provide the necessary inputs:
    - Choose 'encode' or 'decode.'
    - Enter the message to be processed.
    - Specify the shift amount.
2. View the result.
3. Decide whether to restart the program or exit.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a more secure encryption algorithm.
- Add support for different languages.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
