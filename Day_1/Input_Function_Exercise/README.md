# Instructions

Write a program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name.

### Important
Don't add a prompt to the input() function

e.g. use

name = input()

rather than:

name = input("What's your name?")

input() will give you access to anything that's typed in the input pane

### Hint
A function that calculates the length of a string

### Example Input
```
Jane
```
Jane = 4 characters

### Example Output
```
4
```
