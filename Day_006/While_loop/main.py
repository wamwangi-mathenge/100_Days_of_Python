# While Loop Syntax

# while something_is_true:
    # Do this
    # Then do this
    # Then do this
    
    
# For loops are great when you need to iterate over something and you need to do something with each thing you're iterating over.

fruits = ["Apple", "Pear", "Orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    
# While loops are used when you don't care what number in the sequence you're in, which item you're iterating over in the list
# Used when you want to carry out some functionality, many times until some condition is met
